# Caleb's Custom Vulkan Engine

Hi, welcome to my Github page! As of September 25th, 2025, I've made this repository public for all to see my progress! There'll be lots of updates in the coming weeks, months, maybe even years!

  <p><em>A shadow mapping implementation written under my codebase</em></p>

## Goals for this project are as follows

Learning and exploring...
* the basics of Vulkan
* better coding practices in C++
* advanced graphics techniques
* modern real-time physics implementations

And...
* making cool freakin demos and sharing these experiences

It's been my dream from the day I started my journey into game development to be able to build my own stuff. This project aims to fulfill that whollistically.
