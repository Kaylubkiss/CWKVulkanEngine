## Goals for this project are as follows

Learning...
* the basics of Vulkan
* better coding practices in C++
* advanced graphics techniques

And...
* making a cool freakin product

It's been my dream from the day I started my journey into game development to be able to build my own stuff. This project aims to fulfill that whollistically.
